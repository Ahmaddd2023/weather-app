<p class="brn-text">
  A cookie is a small file your browser stores on your device’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Namely, it records information about the use and activity of the Website. This information may include, but is not limited to, your Internet Protocol address, browser type, and the user’s web browsing history before visiting the Website, our Website’s search history. Some cookies are “first-party cookies,” meaning we set them. Cookies set by parties other than us are called “third-party cookies.”

    <h3 class="brn-title">Cookies are used for different reasons.</h3>


<p class="brn-text">

There are the necessary cookies, which are required for technical reasons for a website to operate. Some cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of a website but are non-essential to their use. However, certain functionality may become unavailable if you decide not to accept such cookies. Such cookies are called preferences cookies. Some cookies collect information that is used in aggregate form to help a website owner understand how a website is being used. Such cookies are called statistic cookies, either first-party or third-party cookies. A third party, for example, Google, stores a Google Analytics cookie to be able to differentiate between users and be able to show a website owner how many times people visit a website on average (not individually) and information on what pages they've seen, how long the duration was, and so on. Some cookies are used for marketing purposes. These are the "marketing cookies" and are third-party cookies. Third-party cookies are placed by providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) whom a website owner may have engaged to provide advertising services on their behalf. If visitors of a webpage are interested in one of the services from the analysis of information collected by third-party cookies, then advertising material would be projected on third-party websites. You can visit third parties' respective websites to see how data is collected and analyzed by third-party cookies.

<ul>

 <ol class="custom-counter">
  <p class="brn-text">We shall erase the data where one of the following grounds applies:</p>
  <li class="custom-counter brn-text">personal data is no longer necessary for processing;</li>
  <li class="custom-counter brn-text">the person requesting the erasure withdraws consent on which the processing is based (for example, in the case of our newsletter), and there is no other legal ground for the processing;</li>
  <li class="custom-counter brn-text">the data subject objects to the processing, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing or the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing;</li>
  <li class="custom-counter brn-text">the personal data must be erased in compliance with a legal obligation.</li>
</ol>
</ul>


    <p class="brn-text">We shall not proceed to erasure the personal data if the data must be maintained for compliance with a legal obligation or in cases where the processing is required for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. You can also delete data stored in your Account or your Account, as described earlier in this Policy.</p>
