Brains is committed to respecting your privacy and data protection laws and regulations.

<h3 class="brn-title">2. General Principles of the Processing</h3>

<p class="brn-text">
    We collect and process personal data transparently, to the extent necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes, and do not process it further in a manner incompatible with those purposes. We take care that the data we collect are accurate and, when necessary, updated. We take all reasonable steps to immediately delete or rectify personal data, if inaccurate. We process data in a way that guarantees their security, including their protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction, or degradation, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. We are ready to prove at any moment how we adhere to the above principles. We take the appropriate technical and organizational measures for the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. These measures ensure that, by definition, personal data are not made accessible without the intervention of the natural person to an indeterminate number of natural persons. We respect your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable data protection laws and regulations.

   <h3 class="brn-title">3.1.1 COOKIES</h3>
    <p class="brn-text">
        A cookie is a small file your browser stores on your device’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Namely, it records information about the use and activity of the Website. This information may include, but is not limited to, your Internet Protocol address, browser type, and the user’s web browsing history before visiting the Website, our Website’s search history. Some cookies are “first-party cookies,” meaning we set them. Cookies set by parties other than us are called “third-party cookies.”
    </p>




<h3 class="brn-title">Cookies are used for different reasons.</h3>
<p class="brn-text">
    There are the necessary cookies, which are required for technical reasons for a website to operate. Some cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of a website but are non-essential to their use. However, certain functionality may become unavailable if you decide not to accept such cookies. Such cookies are called preferences cookies. Some cookies collect information that is used in aggregate form to help a website owner understand how a website is being used. Such cookies are called statistic cookies, either first-party or third-party cookies. A third party, for example, Google, stores a Google Analytics cookie to be able to differentiate between users and be able to show a website owner how many times people visit a website on average (not individually) and information on what pages they've seen, how long the duration was, and so on. Some cookies are used for marketing purposes. These are the "marketing cookies" and are third-party cookies. Third-party cookies are placed by providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) whom a website owner may have engaged to provide advertising services on their behalf. If visitors of a webpage are interested in one of the services from the analysis of information collected by third-party cookies, then advertising material would be projected on third-party websites. You can visit third parties' respective websites to see how data is collected and analyzed by third-party cookies.
<br><br>
When you visit our Website, you are asked to consent to the use of cookies, and our Cookies Notice informs you about the type of Cookies we use, their provider, the kind of data they collect, their purpose (e.g., session, personalization, marketing, etc.) and their expiry. You may consent to none, one or more of the above cookies. You may withdraw your consent to using cookies at any time during your visit to our Website freely and easily by clicking on the “Manage Cookies Settings” button next to our “Privacy Policy” button.

    You have the right to ask for the erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay.</p>

<ul>

 <ol class="custom-counter">
  <p class="brn-text">We shall erase the data where one of the following grounds applies:</p>
  <li class="custom-counter brn-text">personal data is no longer necessary for processing;</li>
  <li class="custom-counter brn-text">the person requesting the erasure withdraws consent on which the processing is based (for example, in the case of our newsletter), and there is no other legal ground for the processing;</li>
  <li class="custom-counter brn-text">the data subject objects to the processing, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing or the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing;</li>
  <li class="custom-counter brn-text">the personal data must be erased in compliance with a legal obligation.</li>
</ol>
</ul>


    <p class="brn-text">We shall not proceed to erasure the personal data if the data must be maintained for compliance with a legal obligation or in cases where the processing is required for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. You can also delete data stored in your Account or your Account, as described earlier in this Policy.</p>

    <h3 class="brn-title">6.3 Restriction of processing</h3>

    <p class="brn-text">You have the right to request the restriction of processing if the accuracy of personal data is disputed for that period that allows Brainz to verify the accuracy of personal data or based on any other legitimate reason specified in applicable data protection laws. For example, ask us to suspend the processing of your data if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</p>

<p class="brn-text">
    You may oppose processing personal data, which takes place based on an overriding legitimate interest of a Data Controller without your consent. In this case, we no longer process your data unless it demonstrates imperative and legitimate reasons for the processing that outweigh the interests, rights, and freedoms of you as a data subject or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

    <h3 class="brn-title">6.7 Consent Withdrawal</h3>


    <p class="brn-text">Suppose you have consented to collecting, processing, and transferring your data for a specific purpose. In that case, you can withdraw your consent for that particular processing time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will only process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to if we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.
